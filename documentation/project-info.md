Welcome to our Yoga Pose Classification App!

:person_in_lotus_position: Using a routine with 10 Yoga poses, this app will classify your pose and help you practice Yoga at your own pace with your computer or mobile device.

:point_left: To begin, please go to the `Practice Yoga` page from the menu in the sidebar. There, you have the flexibility of choosing the pose to practice with no time limits or restrictions. Once you select a pose, you can either upload an image or take a picture.

:mag: After receiving the image (which is not saved or kept in any way), the app will use a CNN model to classify your Yoga pose.

:muscle: Our model was trained using this publicly available dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutisaxena/yoga-pose-image-classification-dataset) which was rendered using [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) and classified with [EfficientNet](https://keras.io/api/applications/efficientnet/).

We are students at the University of British Columbia Okanagan Campus, and this project was created for the course COSC 490: Student-Directed Seminar (Topic: Advanced Machine Learning).
