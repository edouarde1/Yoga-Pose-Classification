Welcome to our Yoga Pose Classification App!

:person_in_lotus_position: Using a routine with 10 Yoga poses, this app will classify your pose and help you practice Yoga at your own pace with your computer or mobile device.

:point_left: To begin, please go to the `Practice Yoga` page from the menu in the sidebar. There, you have the flexibility of choosing the pose to practice with no time limits or restrictions. Once you select a pose, you can either upload an image or take a picture.

:mag: After receiving the image (which is not saved or kept in any way), the app will use a CNN model to classify your Yoga pose.

:muscle: Our model was trained using the dataset...
